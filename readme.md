# Excalibur

This school project aimed to scrap and solve challenges (low hanging fruits mostly) for CTFd-based CTFs. It was inspired by John Hammond's [Katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana).

It was proposed by [Joytide](https://github.com/Joytide) and [DaVinciCode](https://davincicode.fr).

This was created by:

[Joytide](https://github.com/Joytide), [Feuillou](https://github.com/Feuill0u), [CesarLeLezard](https://github.com/CesarLeLezard), [Keyronne](https://github.com/Keyronne), [thomasAriza](https://github.com/thomasAriza), [InternetXplorer](https://github.com/InternetXplorer), [TheFlizziard](https://github.com/TheFlizziard) and [Exodars](https://github.com/Exodars).

It is highly unfinished, not exhaustive, and not tested enough, but it never hurts to run it on a CTFd.
